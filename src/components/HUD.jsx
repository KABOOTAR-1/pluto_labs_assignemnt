/**
 * 📊 HUD (Heads-Up Display) - 2D Game Information Overlay
 * ====================================================
 *
 * 🎯 WHAT THIS COMPONENT DOES:
 * ✅ Displays critical game information as 2D overlay on 3D scene
 * ✅ Shows player health, score, and enemies killed
 * ✅ Provides settings access during gameplay
 * ✅ Conditionally renders based on showHUD prop
 * ✅ Uses HTML/CSS for crisp text and UI elements
 *
 * 🎨 UI LAYOUT:
 * - Left side: Health bar and statistics (score, enemies killed)
 * - Right side: Settings button (only during gameplay)
 * - Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
 *
 * 🔄 VISIBILITY CONTROL:
 * - Completely hidden when showHUD is false
 * - Always visible during active gameplay (when showHUD is true)
 * - Settings button only appears during PLAYING state
