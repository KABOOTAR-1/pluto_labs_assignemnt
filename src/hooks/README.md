# üîß Hooks Directory - Game Logic AI Guide

## üìÅ Hook Architecture Overview

This directory contains all custom React hooks that implement the core game mechanics. The hook-based architecture separates game logic from rendering, making it easy for AI to understand, modify, and extend gameplay systems.

## üéÆ CORE GAME LOOP PATTERN

All game logic hooks follow this pattern:
```javascript
// Standard hook structure for game mechanics
export const useGameMechanic = (dependencies) => {
  useFrame(() => {
    // Game logic runs every frame (60fps)
    // Access to Three.js scene, physics bodies, and game state
  });
};
```

## üîÑ HOOK INTEGRATION PATTERNS

### **Component ‚Üí Hook Integration:**
```javascript
// Standard pattern for using hooks in components
function GameComponent() {
  // 1. Use hooks to get game logic
  usePlayerMovement(api, gameState, worldBounds);
  usePlayerRotation(playerRef, camera);
  usePlayerShooting(gameState, playerPosition, projectileType, onShoot);
  
  // 2. Render component with hook-driven behavior
  return <mesh ref={playerRef}>...</mesh>;
}
```

### **Hook ‚Üí Atom Integration:**
```javascript
// Hooks read from and write to Jotai atoms
const [gameState] = useAtom(gameStateAtom);
const [playerHealth, setPlayerHealth] = useAtom(playerHealthAtom);
const [enemies, setEnemies] = useAtom(enemiesAtom);
```

### **useFrame Integration:**
```javascript
// Game logic runs in useFrame for 60fps updates
useFrame(() => {
  // Physics calculations
  // State updates  
  // Movement processing
  // Collision detection
});
```

## üìã AI MODIFICATION GUIDELINES

### **Adding New Hooks:**
1. **Follow naming convention:** `use[System][Action].js` (e.g., `useEnemyTeleport.js`)
2. **Use useFrame for game loop:** All game logic should run at 60fps
3. **Integrate with atoms:** Read/write game state via Jotai atoms
4. **Handle dependencies:** Clearly define required parameters
5. **Add comprehensive documentation:** Explain purpose, dependencies, and modification points

### **Modifying Existing Hooks:**
1. **Check component dependencies:** See which components use the hook
2. **Test with all themes:** Ensure changes work across visual themes
3. **Maintain performance:** Avoid expensive operations in useFrame
4. **Preserve API compatibility:** Don't break existing component integrations

### **Common Modification Patterns:**

#### **Adding New Player Abilities:**
```javascript
// Create new hook: usePlayerDash.js
export const usePlayerDash = (api, gameState, dashCooldown) => {
  useFrame(() => {
    // Dash logic implementation
  });
};

// Integrate in Player.jsx:
usePlayerDash(api, gameState, 2000); // 2 second cooldown
```

#### **Creating New Enemy Behaviors:**
```javascript
// Create new hook: useEnemyPatrol.js  
export const useEnemyPatrol = (api, position, patrolPoints) => {
  useFrame(() => {
    // Patrol logic implementation
  });
};

// Use in BaseEnemy.jsx instead of useEnemyChase
```

#### **Adding New Game Mechanics:**
```javascript
// Create new hook: useWeaponUpgrade.js
export const useWeaponUpgrade = (currentWeapon, upgradeLevel) => {
  useFrame(() => {
    // Weapon upgrade logic
  });
};
```

## üö® IMPORTANT NOTES FOR AI

### **Performance Considerations:**
- **useFrame runs at 60fps** - Keep logic lightweight
- **Avoid expensive calculations** in game loop hooks
- **Use refs for object access** instead of state when possible
- **Batch atom updates** to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### **Hook Dependencies:**
- **Physics API** - Required for movement and collision hooks
- **Jotai Atoms** - Required for state management integration  
- **Game State** - Most hooks need gameState for conditional logic
- **Position Arrays** - Use [x, y, z] format consistently

### **Integration Points:**
- **Components** - Hooks are used in component render functions
- **Atoms** - Hooks read/write global game state
- **Physics** - Hooks control Cannon.js physics bodies
- **Three.js** - Hooks manipulate 3D objects and scene

### **Safe to Modify:**
- Individual hook implementations (isolated functionality)
- Hook parameters and configuration
- Game logic within useFrame callbacks
- Performance optimizations

### **Modify with Caution:**
- Hook APIs and return values (affects component integration)
- useFrame timing and performance
- Atom read/write patterns (affects reactivity)
- Physics body manipulation (affects collision)

This hook system provides **complete game logic separation** from rendering, making it easy to understand, modify, and extend gameplay mechanics while maintaining clean component architecture.
